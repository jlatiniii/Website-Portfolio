In my rough draft I have successfully created a navigation bar that includes an "About the Artist" tab, 
an "Artwork" tab, and a "Contact" tab. I uploaded all of the pictures but I'm struggling with positioning them
on the page. I'm not sure how to create space between the picture and the edge of the page. I also don't know how
to have two pictures next to each other in the same row. Furthermore, I have not received the titles of the 
artworks or the descriptions yet so those will be on the artworks page for the full draft. I still need to fix the
navigation bar as well because when each tab is highlighted, the highlighted part takes up too much space. I also 
don't like how the home button is only present on the other pages but there is a gap on the home page. Aside from this,
I think I have come a really long way from where I was a week ago. I have more confidence that I can create this website 
how I had envisioned in the beginning. It's not the most intricate website but it has the minimalistic aesthetic that
I was going for.
