		Hello! I am a third year student at
		<br>
		Pace University located in Manhattan, New York.
		<br>
		I study Psychology and Fine Arts and I
		<br>
		hope to become an art therapist in the future.
		<br>
		Growing up in the Philadelphia area, I was
		constantly surrounded by art and culture.
		<br>
		I was fortunate enough to have such great mentors
		<br>
		from Upper Darby High School to inspire me
		<br>
		to pursue art not only as a hobby, but a career.
		<br>
		This is a portfolio of my artworks I have created
		<br>
		so far during my college career. Enjoy!
