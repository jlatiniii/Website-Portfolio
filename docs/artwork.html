			<span class="caption"><i>Psychedelic Sunset</i> is a depiction of people playing instruments with a sunset in the background. This is my own personal rendition of Matisse, Van Gogh, and Dunham to create an almost psychedelic blend. This piece puts Matisse’s artistic figures into a colorful, almost transcendent world outside of his simpler style.

			This was created with acrylic paints [18x24].

				This piece uses different colored squares and a subtle outline to create my own colorful perspective of leaves. A color is never repeated within the squares, emphasizing the uniqueness of each leaf. This can be related to the concept of polymorphism, where genetic variation occurs.
