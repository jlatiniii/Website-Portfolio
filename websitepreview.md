This is a preview of my website and what I have worked on so far.
I tried to use a template but figured out that was too complicated so I decided to keep it more simple and do the html and css myself.
I'm going for more of a minimlaistic, modern look so I want to keep a white background (which will also provide lots of negative space to add to the visual flow).
I only figured out how to successfully add a picture and a heading, but I was also able to change the sizes of these and center them. 
I also added a border around the heading and changed the color to a light gray. 
Going forward, I need to add a navigation bar that will have links to the "About the Artist" page, the "Artwork" page, and the "Contact" page. 
By clicking on these, I want the user to be brought to a spot on the same page (the screen will just move down) instead of a completely different page. 
Furthermore, on the artworks page I want the user to possibly be shown the pictures of the artwork and then clicking on them will bring them to a description.
However, I don't want to even try and use JavaScript because html and css is already extremely complicated for me to learn. 
I want this website to be simple but aesthetically pleasing at the same time!
